Molecular Docking Analysis of P25942 Protein with Drug Molecules
Overview
This project investigates the molecular docking of five selected drug molecules with the Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily Member 5 (UniProt ID: P25942), also known as CD40. The study includes docking with both the wild-type and three mutated protein models to understand the impact of mutations on binding affinity.

Objectives
Identify potential drug molecules targeting pathways related to P25942.

Perform ligand and protein preparation for docking.

Conduct docking using AutoDock Vina.

Analyze and compare binding affinities across protein variants.

Determine the most promising drug candidate based on binding performance.

3. Protein Models
Wild-Type: P25942.B99990001

Mutant 1: MUT1.B99990003

Mutant 2: MUT2.B99990002

Mutant 3: MUT3.B99990003

Results
Binding Affinity Summary
Strongest Binder: Lig3 (Naphthalene-sulfonamide derivative)

Weakest Binder: Lig2 (2-Chlorobenzyl-piperazine derivative)

Mutant Impact:

Mut1 and Mut3 enhance Lig1 binding.

Mut3 negatively impacts Lig2 binding.

Mut2 improves Lig5 binding.

Visualizations
Docked structures visualized for each ligand-protein combination.

Bar graphs and density plots used to compare binding energies.

Conclusion
Lig3 demonstrates the strongest and most consistent binding across wild-type and Mut2, making it the most promising candidate. Mutations influence ligand affinity in a drug-specific manner, emphasizing the need to consider variant-specific interactions in drug design.
