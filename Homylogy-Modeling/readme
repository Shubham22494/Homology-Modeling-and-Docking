🧬 Homology Modeling and Structural Analysis of Protein P25942
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the homology modeling of the Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 5 (P25942) using MODELLER, followed by structural evaluation of three point mutations. The stability and conformational impact of mutations were analyzed using DOPE scores and RMSD, and visualized through Chimera.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
MODELLER – For homology modeling

Chimera – For 3D visualization and mutation mapping

BLAST – For template identification

Python – For scripting and automation

CASTp – For active site prediction (used in downstream docking)

Conda – Environment management

🧪 Methodology
🔹 1. Template Identification
Used BLAST to find 3 suitable templates with high sequence identity and coverage.

Selected the best template based on alignment metrics.

🔹 2. Mutation Introduction
Introduced 3 point mutations:

P → A at position 227

I → V at position 208

T → M at position 112

🔹 3. Model Generation
Generated 4 models (wild-type + 3 mutants) using MODELLER.

Selected models with the lowest molpdf score for evaluation.

🔹 4. Structural Analysis
DOPE Score calculated for stability:

Wild-type: -17296.05

Mutation1: -16268.22

Mutation2: -16623.35

Mutation3: -17123.97

RMSD calculated for deviation from wild-type:

Mutation1: 1.057 Å

Mutation2: 0.778 Å

Mutation3: 0.937 Å

🔹 5. Visualization
Rendered 40+ 3D structural views in Chimera, highlighting:

H-bonds

Mutation positions

Template overlays

Structural overlaps

📊 Key Insights
Mutation 3 (T → M) was the most stable among the mutants.

Mutation 2 (I → V) showed the least structural deviation.

Mutation 1 (P → A) had the most destabilizing effect.
